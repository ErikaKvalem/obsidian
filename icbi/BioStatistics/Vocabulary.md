PCA  - Principal component analysis
	PCA focuses on shared variance: it tries to summarize multiple variables in the minimum number of components so that each component explains the most variance.
PCoA  - Principal coordinate analysis
	PCoA on the other hand focuses on distances, and it tries to extract the dimensions that account for the maximum distances.
