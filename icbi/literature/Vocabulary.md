Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) - 
Colonocyte - Epithelial cell of the colon
[Butyrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid#Biochemistry) - Primary colonocyte energy source important for mantaining epithelial integrity and intestinal homeostasis. 
[Serum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_(blood)) - Serum includes all proteins not used in blood clotting; all electrolytes, antibodies, antigens, hormones and any exogenous  substances (e.g drugs or microorganisms). Serum does not contain white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, or clotting factors
[Systemic circulation](https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cardiovascular/blood/pathways.html#:~:text=The%20systemic%20circulation%20provides%20the,the%20tissues%20of%20the%20body.)- The systemic circulation provides the functional blood supply to all body tissue. It carries oxygen and nutrients to the cells and picks up carbon dioxide and waste products. Systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, through the arteries, to the capillaries in the tissues of the body.

#gavage - sonda 
#antineoplastic - Antineoplastic drugs are medications used to treat cancer. Other names for antineoplastic drugs are anticancer, chemotherapy, chemo, cytotoxic, or hazardous drugs.
#shotgun_metagenomic_sequencing   - Shotgun metagenomic sequencing **allows researchers to comprehensively sample all genes in all organisms present in a given complex sample**. The method enables microbiologists to evaluate bacterial diversity and detect the abundance of microbes in various environments (Metagenomic NGS (mNGS))

#Flow_cytometry
#exon_sequencing 
#WGS whole genome sequencing - comprehensive view of the genome (coding, non-coding and mitochondrial DNA)
#WES whole exon sequencing - target the protein coding regions of the genome , detects coding variants 

Flow cytometry 
FACS - Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
Forward Scatter (FSC) - relative to size
Side Scatter (SSC) - relative to granularity ( the more stuff inside their cytoplasm, the larger side scatter and the more granular they are  )
