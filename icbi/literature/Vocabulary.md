Colonocyte - Epithelial cell of the colon
[Butyrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid#Biochemistry) - Primary colonocyte energy source important for mantaining epithelial integrity and intestinal homeostasis. 
[Serum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_(blood)) - Serum includes all proteins not used in blood clotting; all electrolytes, antibodies, antigens, hormones and any exogenous  substances (e.g drugs or microorganisms).

[Systemic circulation](https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cardiovascular/blood/pathways.html#:~:text=The%20systemic%20circulation%20provides%20the,the%20tissues%20of%20the%20body.)- The systemic circulation provides the functional blood supply to all body tissue. It carries oxygen and nutrients to the cells and picks up carbon dioxide and waste products. Systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, through the arteries, to the capillaries in the tissues of the body.
