1.  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a type of cancer that affects the colon and rectum.
2.  The molecular subtypes of CRC are different groups of tumors that have distinct genetic and biological characteristics.
3.  Researchers aimed to identify and characterize the consensus molecular subtypes of CRC.
4.  They analyzed the genetic and molecular data of over 1,000 CRC tumors.
5.  The data was used to identify common patterns and subgroups of tumors with similar features.
6.  Four consensus molecular subtypes of CRC were identified: CMS1, CMS2, CMS3, and CMS4.
7.  Each subtype has unique characteristics such as gene mutations, metabolic pathways, and response to therapy.
8.  The study found that the subtypes are predictive of patient outcomes and can help guide treatment decisions.
9.  The researchers validated their findings by analyzing data from independent patient cohorts.
10.  The consensus molecular subtypes provide a deeper understanding of the biology of CRC and may inform future therapeutic approaches.

Experiments performed:

1.  Tumor tissue samples were collected and analyzed for genetic and molecular data.
2.  The data was analyzed using computational methods to identify patterns and subgroups of tumors.
3.  The findings were validated using data from independent patient cohorts.
4.  The results were further analyzed to understand the biological and therapeutic implications of the consensus molecular subtypes.
