EFFICACY OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY

Gut microbiota is a part of the organism that can be targeted to cure diseases related to infections or inflammations. 

commensal bacteria strains --> CD4T cells --> T helper 17 (Th17) & T regulatory (Treg)
commensal bacteria strains --> CD8T cells --> theory: improve host immune control against pathogen infection and efficacy of cancer immunotherapies 

SPF mice (specific pathogen free mice ) --> lamina propia vs other organs  -->abundance of IFNgamma-expressing CD8T cells (differenciated from conventioanl CD8T cells) 

IFgCD8T cells express CD103 marker --> marker of tissue resident memory T cells 
IFgCD8T cells express  Granzyme B (GrB) marker --> key effector molecules cytotoxic T cells 

less IFgCD8T cells in germ free mice vs SPF mice 
SPF mice + antbiotic --> reduced  IFgCD8T 

faecal suspension from SPF oral administration --> germ free mice increase IFgCD8T population

co-housing SPF and germ free mice --> increase in IFgCD8T  cell population relative abundance

These results suggest: 
IFgCD8T  abundance is plastic 
IFgCD8T  can be promoted and reversed by microbiota 

AIM OF THE STUDY: 
Isolate specific bacteria strain that can induce the accumulation of IFgCD8T in the intestine. 


1. Isolation of IFgCD8T inducing human strains 
- 11 strains have non-inflammatory immunomodulatory activity that is relatively specific to CD8T cells 
- 11 strains act as a consortium in which the 4 non-Bacteriodales species act as effector elements and the 7 Bacteroidales have a supporting role. 

2. Mechanisms underlying IFgCD8T cell accumulation 

- Colonization with live 11mix upregulated the expression of chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 as well as other #IFN-inducible_genes in colonic epithelial cells 
- The strains have the ability to enter the colonic mucus layer, but the bacteria were not detected in the epithelium 
- Active colonization near epithelial cells might establish an IFg mediated feed forward loop that promotes the recruitment and accumulation of IFgCD8T 
- The accumulation of IFgCD8T cells is probably due to cumulative effects of colonic recruitment, cellular expansion and bacterial antigen-mediated differenciation.
- The 11 strains activate signaling independently of major innate immune pathways. This conditions CD103+ lamina propria dendritic cells to induce IFgCD8T cell accumulation in MHC class Ia-dependent manner. 

3. Systemic effects of 11mix colonization 

- Hypothesis: Systemic effects may be due to circulating metabolites induced by the 11 strains

4. Enhancement of anti-tumour immunity 

- Notably 11 mix coloniation significantly suppressed tumour growth even in the abscence of anti-PD-1 treatment
- 11 strains are capable of enhancing both spontaneous and ICI mediated anti tumour immunity in a CD8T cell dependent manner. 
- The 11 strains have the capacity to simultaneously enhance ICI therapies and negate their colitogenic side effects. 

5. Dicussion
Isolation of 11 bacteria strain that have positive effect on the host immune control agains infectious pathogens as well as enhance immunotherapy efficaty and negate the colitogenic side effects.
