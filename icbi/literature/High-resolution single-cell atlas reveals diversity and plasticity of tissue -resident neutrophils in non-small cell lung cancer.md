## Summary
- The paper describes a high-resolution single-cell atlas of tissue-resident neutrophils in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- The study aimed to understand the diversity and plasticity of tissue-resident neutrophils in NSCLC.
- Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed on over 50,000 cells from NSCLC patients.
- The results showed significant heterogeneity among tissue-resident neutrophils in NSCLC.
- The study identified distinct subpopulations of tissue-resident neutrophils with different gene expression profiles.
- Some subpopulations were found to be enriched for immune signaling pathways and gene sets related to cancer.
- The results showed evidence of plasticity in the tissue-resident neutrophils, suggesting that they can change their gene expression profile in response to their environment.
- A correlation was found between the gene expression profiles of tissue-resident neutrophils and the clinical outcome of NSCLC patients.
- The study highlights the importance of characterizing the heterogeneity and plasticity of tissue-resident neutrophils in NSCLC.
- The high-resolution single-cell atlas provides a resource for further investigation of the role of tissue-resident neutrophils in NSCLC.
