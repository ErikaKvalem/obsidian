## Summary
- Firmicutes-affiliated bacteria
   - 5 gut bacterial strains
      - affiliated with
         - Clostridium clusters
            - IV
            - XIV
               - All these clusters have NF-kB suppresive activity
            - XV
- biochemical & intraspecies variations
- Changing the host immune response can help the bacterias in the gut to recolonize and keep living in the gut environment
- The gut microbiota has the ability to affect the host immune system and affect immune homeostasis (equilibrium)
   - This is the reason why if the gut micriobiota is altered it can trigger diseases in genetically predisposed individuals
- IBD Immune bowel disease
   - Test
      - The capacity of bacteria to eliminate cytokine produced inflammatory responses
   - Result
      - heat- & Proeinase K-resilient bioactives
         - work strongly suppressing IL-8 in several cases
