## Abstract
- what
   - intracellular bacteria present in HLA-I and HLA-II molecules in melanoma tumours
- who
   - 9 patients
      - 17 melanoma metastases
         - 16S rRNA gene sequencing & HLA peptidomics
- effect
   - 41 species of bacteria
      - derive
         - 35 unique HLA-I & HLA-II peptides
- conclussion
   - peptides derived from intracellular bacteria ca be present in tumour cells and elicit immune reactivity
   - this can be a mechanism by which bacteria influence the activation of the immune system and affect response to therapy

## Introduction
- Species of bacteria identified in melanoma
   - 17 melanoma samples (9 patients)
      - 41 distinct species of bacteria
         - high simiilarity of bacteria between patients and between samples of same patient
         - microbial richness
            - higher in tumour than in bloos
- Presentation of bacterial peptides
   - HLA I & HLA II peptidome analysis from the 17 melanoma samples
      - 248 unique HLA I associated peptides
      - 35 unique HLA II associated peptides
      - bacteria derived peptides were more hydrophobic than human derived
         - this peptides might be preferable for antigen presentation and recognition by T cells
      - bacterial HLA peptides
         - come from
            - melanoma cells
            - antigen-presenting cells
               - previously showed that bacteria can enter antigen presenting cells
- Entry of bacteria into melanoma cells
   - cocultureÂ  melanoma cells + bacteria from HLA peptides were identified
      - confirmed bacteria enter the melanoma cells
- Bacterial presentation is specific
   - bacterial peptides identifed are HLA ligands
      - their presence was reduced when HLA knock-out and with less invasive bacteria were used
- Tumour isolated bacterial presentation
- Recurrently presented bacterial peptides
- Bacterial peptides are immunogenic
